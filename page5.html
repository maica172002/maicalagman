have this kind of Family. Not broken and only Love is on the Top to make my family faightful and happy. My parents always take care of us they never let us sad. My mom told me that "Time is Gold" cherish every moment and time we spend together, and my dad told me that "Acceptance is the key of peaceful life" he always remaind us that being a good person is making our society good as well.
